## Using the terminal 
```
Cd .. > Goes back one
Cd <directory> goes forward one
Ls > List files
Mkdir <directory> Creates a folder
Pwd > Prints where you are now (Working directory)
``` 
Also useful:
``` 
clear  > Clear terminal
rm <file> Delete
echo > hello.py (Creates file)
code .   (Open vscode in said location)
``` 
Understand relative paths from where you are:
``` 
cp ./folder1/file.txt ./folder2/ (Copy for current directory) 
cp myfile.txt ../ (Copy a file up one) 
```
