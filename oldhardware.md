# Reviving Old Hardware

Last week I installed Ubuntu on a recycled build:
 ```
	Motherboard: Acer
	Product Name: Nitro N50-600
  CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz
  GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4GiB GDDR5 
  PSU: CX850M Corsair
  S: Patriot NVMe 512gb
  RAM: Crucial x2 8GiB @ 2400MT/s DDR4
``` 

Now you would think a graphics card from 2016 would be totally obsolete...
Or at least on Windows it was. 

Here are some commands for you to check all of this on linux:

MB: sudo dmidecode -t baseboard
CPU: lspcu
GPU: lspci | grep VGA
RAM: sudo dmidecode -t memory
STORAGE: lsblk -d -o NAME,TYPE,VENDOR,MODEL,SIZE

Make sure to have installed all the drivers needed, you can find them in the other guides in this repo. 
I will not go over steam either as there is a little to do (you can also find it in the main repo at the very end. And more info in commonissues)

Now let's work our way up. 
We'll start with minecraft and finish with much larger game. 

Step 0: Prereqs
Nvidia drivers, X11 tools etc

I will also be testing with most setting on low, as I personally prefer performance over quality. 

I always start with minecraft for two reasons:

One they have the neat F3 with FPS, GPU, CPU etc 
Two it's a chunk based game so you it's a good baseline to compare.
