### SESSION TYPE NOT SWITCHING OR NEED X11 FOR GAMES

  `sudo echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE`

Want to try x11 from wayland?

Dont forget to 

  `sudo apt install xserver-xorg`

Then restart and when logging back on kde small button to switch to x11, same for many distros it's in log-in screen.

You can then run the first command again to check. 
Hopefully you get output: `x11`

Especially useful if you're on Windows user and want low level x11 access. See remote sessions in main readme file of this repo.

If you want to go a step further down the rabbit hole: 
`cat /etc/X11/default-display-manager
/usr/sbin/gdm3`

Then: `sudo nano /etc/gdm3/custom.conf` 

And uncomment the line: 
`WaylandEnable=false`

Now this might vary based on if you chose another display manager. 

    LightDM: /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
    GDM3: /etc/gdm3/custom.conf
    SDDM: /etc/sddm.conf

### Graphics card not being used Linux

I've recently been installing Linux on older machines that have both an integrated GPU and a small NVIDIA card.

Here are the steps:
```lspci | grep -i vga``` if you want to check your graphics devices

Make sure everything is up to date, check graphics drivers: ```nvidia-smi``` and ``` ubuntu-drivers devices``` this should detect your graphics card and recommend you the right version.

If not you need to find the right drivers follow install commands ```sudo apt install nvidia-driver-XXX```

Mine crashed during the end of the install but still worked? I guess just let it run even if it's not moving for a bit?
Make sure to reboot after install.

Then once you have that you you have to make sure you're in x11 and have both nvidia-prime and sudo apt install xserver-xorg-video-nouveau

Finally you can open NVIDIA X SERVER SETTINGS (just a fancy way of saying graphics libraries)

Go to: PRIME Profiles and select NVIDIA Performance mode. If it's not there, your graphics card might still be used as long as you have the X settings thing and it your GPU is detected. 

Now it will ask you to restart and voilÃ !

I also like to download minecraft to check using F3 if it is actually using the GPU and usually you can see a x2 increase in FPS compared to integrated, even on older hardware. I got a nice stable 120 with a 950 with 2GB of memory. 

If you want to do that make sure you isntalled java ``` sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk ```

Last thing if you actually want to play a bit and your trackpad isn't working at the same time as your keys in KDE there is a switch for it in your settings directly:

**If you're on even older hardware you can also set the graphics mode to High Perfomance instead of Quality by default**

Go to OPENGL Then select High Performance.

### Veryfing Shim SBAT data failed: Security Policy Violation
Something has gone SERIOUSLY wrong with SBAT self-check failed: Security Policy Violation

FIX: (MSI motherboard) 

You have to find some boot setting in your BIOS:
Boot > Secure Boot
OS Type > Other OS

You might for some OSes also need to disable fast boot setting which can break installs.

### ALERT! UUID=XXXXXXXX doesn't exist. Dropping to a shell. 
Gave up waiting for system root device. Common problems.


THis one is stupid. So when you unplug an old motherboard it might default back to IDE Legacy or RST. But modern Ubuntu needs AHCI. 

If you have a Acer Bios you will need to go to Advanced > Integrated Peripherals.
Then change the Onboard SATA Mode.
