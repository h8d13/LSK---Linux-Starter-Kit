1. Veryfing Shim SBAT data failed: Security Policy Violation
Something has gone SERIOUSLY wrong with SBAT self-check failed: Security Policy Violation

FIX: (MSI motherboard)

Boot > Secure Boot
OS Type > Other OS

You might for some OSes also need to disable fast boot setting which can break installs.
