Something has gone SERIOUSLY wrong with SBAT self-check failed: Security Policy Violation

FIX: (MSI motherboard)

### SESSION TYPE NOT SWITCHING 

Want to try x11 from wayland?

Dont forget to 

sudo apt install xserver-xorg

Then restart and when logging back on kde small button to switch to x11.

Especially useful if you're on Windows user and want low level x11 access. See remote sessions in main readme file of this repo.

If you want to go a step further and develop directly with x11:

sudo apt install libx11-dev

You'll need to compile you can use gcc or make for convenience. Good luck!
