# Simple scripts

The idea is that you can build tools that enhance your workflow, I personally don't like having to use extra commands so I can create a short 150 line script that will handle all my versions of a codebase. 

The difference with classic history is that it's there on the disk, even weeks later after hunderds of changes, you can go back to a specific date to look for the genius snippet of code. 

It's not lost in some complicated system.
