## Create a tool for your own usage!

I personally like to work locally and was never a big fan of having extra commands to do in terminal. 

So instead you can create scripts that will help you in your workflow. 

Here is a basic example of what that might look like. 

Simple version tacking system: Monitors the Current Working Directory (cwd) and is able to save locally while ignoring annoying files.

The advantage of this approach is clear: Create the tools you need for what you're trying to achieve.
